5.Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?

You should simple change DeviceName in code: capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", name of real device);
For example: capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "520082bfea8a2571");

6.Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
 Are there any difference with run on emulator?

You need to:
1.turn on the developer mode on physical device,
2.enable USB debugging,
3.connect device to via USB
After you connect real device via USB you need to allow this computer to work with the device
(possible click OK in pop up).
Run Appium server, fill new set of capabilities (deviceName, platformName, browserName or app)
for the divice if you want to work with Inspector.
The differences which I have noticed:
I had to update Chrome in emulator because of error with versions of chrome at emulator and chromedriver at appium.
Also unlike emulator, real device does not slow down the laptop which makes work faster.
