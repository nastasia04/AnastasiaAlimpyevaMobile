4.
Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity.
 Does this approach work?


No. I had this error:
"org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Unable to create a new remote session.
Please check the server log for more details.
Original error: {"status":13,"value":{"message":"An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command.
Original error: The desired capabilities must include either an app, appPackage or browserName"},"sessionId":null}"
